<h1>About</h1>

This project is an automated diagnostic script for checking network connectivity with different online games servers.
It will try to resolve all domains normally resolved by game client, and then it will try to ping/traceroute to all discovered addresses.
Whole output is saved into a log file, which can be later sent to ISP or game's developers.
